# Graphics-programming
 This project reads in 3d geometry primitives from a VTK file, rasterize those geometry onto a screen to create a 3D object, and then create a movie from multiple camera frames. The finished result is on this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1NtQB1GASg
To run this project, you need to have Cmake and VTK 8.3 pre-installed
